# Pi-Approximation-And-Sorting

This project demonstrates two approaches to approximate the value of π (Pi):

Monte Carlo Method: Uses random sampling within the unit square to estimate π based on points inside the unit circle.
Grid Sampling Method: Uses a double for-loop to systematically check points on a grid within the unit square to approximate π.

Implemented in Java, the program compares accuracy and performance between the two methods.
